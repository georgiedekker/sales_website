## 5. Validation of Completeness and Non-Overlap {#validation}

The feature set described above covers the complete lifecycle of the RaiseMyTicket.com platform:

1. **Marketing Feature**: Covers the initial introduction of the platform's benefits to potential clients.
2. **Sales Feature**: Addresses the process of converting interest into contractual relationships.
3. **New Company Onboarding Feature**: Details the implementation process for new contracted companies.
4. **Production Usage Feature**: Illustrates the day-to-day operation of the platform across different service categories.

These features are designed to be distinct with minimal overlap, each addressing a specific phase in the platform's relationship with client organizations:

- Marketing targets potential clients who are not yet customers
- Sales focuses on demonstrating capabilities and finalizing contracts
- Onboarding applies only to new companies that have signed contracts but are not yet operational
- Production usage applies to fully implemented companies with employees actively using the system

Together, these features provide a comprehensive view of the RaiseMyTicket.com platform's functionality, from initial marketing to ongoing usage, ensuring that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the system's capabilities and behaviors.
